# Net-Logger


Net Logger is a tool which helps to analize logs. It automatically updates the Log UI when the actual file is being changed . The line highlight feature helps to differentiate between newly added logs and old logs . You will be able to see the new Log count in browser Title bar .

## Installation
Installation is very easy .Put this logger folder in the same directory of the log file. Then we just need to create one virtual directory in IIS / Xamp or in any other web server . Change the log filename in "settings.js" . And That's It . You are ready to use the tool.
